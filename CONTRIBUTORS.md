## Contribution Guide
These are some tips on how to properly format pull requests, issues, and contribute gracefully to Py4Dummies. Thank you!

## First
Make sure you have an account on [git.bendaws.net](https://git.bendaws.net). All development of Py4Dummies happens on there, and other repositories under the `py4dummies` name are mirrors.

Our canonical Git repository is avaliable publically at https://git.bendaws.net/py4dummies/py4dummies. It hosts the [issue tracker](https://git.bendaws.net/py4dummies/py4dummies/issues) and [pull requests](https://git.bendaws.net/py4dummies/py4dummies/pulls).

## Issues
Issue titles are prefixed with one of our tags, which you can see below.

| Tag      | Description                                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `[bug]`  | Bugs and problems with py4dummies                                        |
| `[feat]` | Feature requests: request new features or share cool ideas               |
| `[docs]` | Updates to documentation, typos, undocumented features, or vague wording |
| `[misc]` | Everything else that cannot fit into one of the other 3 tags             |

Issue descriptions should be formatted like this:
```md
<!-- Write a description of the problem under this line -->

I'm having an issue

<!-- and above this one -->
## Version Info
<!-- This is where version info is listed. To get the version of any software here, run an executable from it with the argument "--version". -->

| Software   | Version                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Py4Dummies | `[version number here]` |
| Python     | `[version number here]` |
```

Write a good description of what your pull request changes. It doesn't have to be long, just descriptive enough where we understand what the change is.

You can also link an issue number (`#X`) that your pull request is aimed to fix. When merging your pull request, we will close any related issues.
